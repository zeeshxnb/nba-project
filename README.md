*Predicting the outcomes of NBA playoff series using historical regular season data.*

## Project Goal
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive system that can accurately forecast the winner of any given NBA playoff series. By analyzing team performance metrics from the regular season, the system identifies the key statistical factors that correlate with playoff success. This allows us to simulate the entire playoff bracket and predict the eventual NBA Champion.
